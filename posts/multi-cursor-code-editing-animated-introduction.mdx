When editing text, especially structured text, the need occurs to make repeated changes in multiple locations. A common case is renaming a variable.

```javascript
const element = document.querySelect("#container");

if (element && element.hasAttribute("data-active")) {
  element.classList.add("active");
}
// @script slow-rename
```

<CodeScript id="slow-rename" script={[
  { command: "Select Word", word: "element", line: 1 },
  { command: "Type", text: "container" },
  { command: "Select Word", word: "element", line: 3 },
  { command: "Type", text: "container" },
  { command: "Select Word", word: "element", line: 3 },
  { command: "Type", text: "container" },
  { command: "Select Word", word: "element", line: 4 },
  { command: "Type", text: "container" },
]} />

Select and type, select and type.

For a small block of code it's fine. A bit tedious, but fine. Banging this out doesn't take a lot of time.

However, the number of keystrokes grows linearly. Increasing the number of references to a few dozens already makes the task quite taxing.

We want the effort for repeated changes to grow in a non-linear fashion. We can do that using <Command>Command D</Command>.

```javascript
const element = document.querySelect("#container");

if (element && element.hasAttribute("data-active")) {
  element.classList.add("active");
}
// @script fast-rename
```

<CodeScript id="fast-rename" script={[
  { command: "Select Word", word: "element", line: 1 },
  { command: "Command D", times: 3, msBetween: 300 },
  { command: "Type", text: "container" },
]} />

<SmallNote>This post is focused on VS Code, but <Command small faded>Command D</Command> can be used in other text editors such as Sublime Text. Other text editors will have analogous keyboard shortcuts.<NotMacOs><br /><span style={{ marginTop: 8, display: "block" }}>On Windows and Linux, the keyboard shortcut is <Command small faded>Control D</Command>. This post is MacOS-oriented, but non-Mac shortcuts will be displayed throughout.</span></NotMacOs></SmallNote>

<Command noMarginLeft>Command D</Command> selects the next instance of whatever you have selected, which enables multi-cursor editing.

Using <Command>Command D</Command> seems deceptively simple. Find a pattern to match, and then make the change:

```txt
// @script markdown-bullets-to-checkboxes
- Task 1
- Task 2
  - Subtask A
  - Subtask B
  - Subtask C
    - Subtask D
- Task 3
  - Another subtask
```

<CodeScript id="markdown-bullets-to-checkboxes" script={[
  { command: "Shift Right" },
  { command: "Command D", times: 7 },
  { command: "Right" },
  { command: "Type", text: " [ ]" },
  { command: "Command Up" },
]} />

There's already a lot of value in using <Command>Command D</Command> for simple transformations, such as the above, but we're just scratching the surface. Combined with smart text navigation techniques, we can take <Command>Command D</Command> quite far.


## Navigating text

First off, the basics.

 * __Arrow keys__ to move the cursor
 * __Shift__ to select text while moving the cursor.

```
// @script arrow-keys loop
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
```

<CodeScript id="arrow-keys" script={[
  { command: "Right", times: 4, msBetween: 140, msAfter: 700 },
  { command: "Shift Right", times: 5, msBetween: 140, msAfter: 700 },
  { command: "Left", times: 5, msBetween: 140 },
]} />

Use <Command>Option</Command> to jump over words.

```
// @script jump-over-words loop
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
```

<CodeScript id="jump-over-words" script={[
  { command: "Option Right", times: 3, msBetween: 300, msAfter: 300 },
  { command: "Right", msAfter: 700 },
  { command: "Shift Option Right", times: 2, msBetween: 300 },
  { command: "Option Left", times: 5, msBetween: 300 },
]} />

<NotMacOs>
  <SmallNote label="">Use <Command small faded>Control</Command> with the arrow keys to jump over words on Windows and Linux.</SmallNote>
</NotMacOs>

Jumping over words allows us to navigate text containing words of different lengths.

```javascript
// @script jump-over-words-demonstration
const items = [
  { show: types.indexOf("added") !== -1 },
  { show: types.indexOf("started") !== -1 },
  { show: types.indexOf("completed") !== -1 },
]
```

<CodeScript id="jump-over-words-demonstration" script={[
  { command: "Select Word", line: 2, word: "indexOf", msAfter: 700 },
  { command: "Command D", times: 2 },
  { command: "Type", text: "includes" },
  { command: "Option Right", times: 3 },
  { command: "Shift Option Right", times: 2 },
  { command: "Backspace" },
]} />

Use <Command>Command</Command> to jump to the beginning or end of a line.

```
// @script jump-to-end-start-of-line loop
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
```

<CodeScript id="jump-to-end-start-of-line" script={[
  { command: "Shift Command Right", msAfter: 1000 },
  { command: "Right" },
  { command: "Command Left" },
]} />

<NotMacOs>
  <SmallNote label="">On Windows and Linux, use <Command small faded>Home</Command> and <Command small faded>End</Command> to jump to the beginning and end of a line, respectively.</SmallNote>
</NotMacOs>

Jumping to line boundaries allows us to navigate text that contains a variable number of words.

```javascript
// @script jump-to-end-start-of-line-demonstration loop
const items = [
  { id: 1, content: ["foo", "bar"] },
  { id: 2, content: [] },
  { id: 3, content: ["baz"] },
]
```

<CodeScript id="jump-to-end-start-of-line-demonstration" script={[
  { command: "Select Word", line: 2, word: "content" },
  { command: "Command D", times: 2 },
  { command: "Right", times: 3 },
  { command: "Type", text: "new Set(" },
  { command: "Command Right" },
  { command: "Left", times: 3 },
  { command: "Type", text: ")" },
]} />

With text navigation locked down, let's do some cool stuff.


## Finding the pattern

Take this example of converting a series of `if` statements to a switch statement.


```javascript
// @script turn-ifs-into-switch expectedLines=13
if (element.type === "property") {
  return formatProperty(element);
}

if (element.type === "modifier") {
  return formatModifier(element);
}

if (element.type === "group") {
  return formatGroup(element);
}
```

<CodeScript id="turn-ifs-into-switch" script={[
  { command: "Select Word", word: "element.type", line: 1 },
  { command: "Copy" },
  { command: "Shift Command Enter" },
  { command: "Type", text: "switch (" },
  { command: "Paste" },
  { command: "Type", text: ") {", msAfter: 200 },
  { command: "Down", msAfter: 150 },
  { command: "Command Left" },
  { command: "Shift Command Down" },
  { command: "Tab" },
  { command: "Right" },
  { command: "Type", text: "\n}" },
  { command: "Select Word", word: "if (", line: 2 },
  { command: "Command D", times: 2, msBetween: 200 },
  { command: "Type", text: "case " },
  { command: "Shift Option Right", times: 3 },
  { command: "Shift Right" },
  { command: "Backspace" },
  { command: "Command Right" },
  { command: "Shift Left", times: 3 },
  { command: "Backspace" },
  { command: "Type", text: ":" },
  { command: "Down", times: 2 },
  { command: "Shift Up" },
  { command: "Shift Command Right" },
  { command: "Backspace" },
]} />

The `if` statements all have the exact same structure, so matching them is somewhat trivial. These sorts of patterns are the bread and butter of <Command>Command D</Command>, they're very common.

But <Command>Command D</Command> is still very effective for non-uniform patterns. Those more complex patterns can come in the form of

 * a variable number of arguments,
 * a variable number of words in a string, or
 * different argument types.

Let's take a look at an example.


### Non-uniform patterns

Let's say that we're developing a library for evaluating math expressions.

```tsx
import { evaluate } from "imaginary-mathlib";

evaluate("2 * 4"); // 8
evaluate("[5, 10] / 2"); // [2.5, 5]
evaluate("1 > 1/2 ? 1 : 'err'"); // 1
```

In making testing the library less verbose, we made a utility function that takes an expression, and its expected value.

```tsx
function expectEqual(expression: string, expectedValue: any): void;
```

We have some test code using it that looks like so:

```tsx
expectEqual("2**4", 16);
expectEqual("1/0", ERR_DIV_ZERO);
expectEqual("[1, 3, 5] * 2", [2, 6, 10]);
expectEqual("1/10 < 0.2 ? 'a' : 'b'", "a");
```

However, we want to convert this test code into the following:

```tsx
const tests = [
  { expression: "2**4", value: 16 },
  { expression: "1/0", value: ERR_DIV_ZERO },
  { expression: "[1, 3, 5] * 2", value: [2, 6, 10] },
  { expression: "1/10 < 0.2 ? 'a' : 'b'", value: "a" },
];
```

Since we have a lot of tests, doing this manually would be a lot of work. This is a prime case for using <Command>Command D</Command>, we just need to find a pattern to match.

If we match `expectEqual` and move in from there, we run into the problem of the expressions being of different lengths.

```javascript
// @script match-expect-equal
expectEqual("2**4", 16);
expectEqual("1/0", ERR_DIV_ZERO);
expectEqual("[1, 3, 5] * 2", [2, 6, 10]);
expectEqual("1/10 < 0.2 ? 'a' : 'b'", "a");
```

<CodeScript id="match-expect-equal" script={[
  { command: "Select Word", word: "expectEqual", line: 1 },
  { command: "Command D", times: 3 },
  { command: "Right", times: 2 },
  { command: "Shift Option Right", times: 4 },
]} />

Matching the end runs into the same problem. The values are of different lengths.

```javascript
// @script match-end
expectEqual("2**4", 16);
expectEqual("1/0", ERR_DIV_ZERO);
expectEqual("[1, 3, 5] * 2", [2, 6, 10]);
expectEqual("1/10 < 0.2 ? 'a' : 'b'", "a");
```

<CodeScript id="match-end" script={[
  { command: "Select Word", word: ");", line: 1 },
  { command: "Command D", times: 3 },
  { command: "Left" },
  { command: "Shift Option Left" },
]} />

If we try to match the commas `,` between the expression and the value, we also match commas within the expressions and expected values:

```javascript
// @script match-comma
expectEqual("2**4", 16);
expectEqual("1/0", ERR_DIV_ZERO);
expectEqual("[1, 3, 5] * 2", [2, 6, 10]);
expectEqual("1/10 < 0.2 ? 'a' : 'b'", "a");
```

<CodeScript id="match-comma" script={[
  { command: "Select Word", word: ",", line: 1 },
  { command: "Command D", times: 7, msBetween: 200 },
]} />

The expression and expected value can be of any length, so matching the start or end is of no use.

However, we can observe that the expression is always a string. The expression always ends with double quote `"` immediately followed by a comma `,`. That's a pattern we can match!

```javascript
// @script match-quote-and-comma expectedLines=6
expectEqual("2**4", 16);
expectEqual("1/0", ERR_DIV_ZERO);
expectEqual("[1, 3, 5] * 2", [2, 6, 10]);
expectEqual("1/10 < 0.2 ? 'a' : 'b'", "a");
```

<CodeScript id="match-quote-and-comma" script={[
  { command: "Select Word", word: "\",", line: 1 },
  { command: "Command D", times: 3, msBetween: 150 },
  { command: "Right" },
  { command: "Type", text: " value:" },
  { command: "Command Right" },
  { command: "Backspace", times: 2 },
  { command: "Type", text: " }," },
  { command: "Command Left" },
  { command: "Shift Option Right" },
  { command: "Shift Right" },
  { command: "Type", text: "{ expression: " },
  { command: "Command Up" },
  { command: "Shift Command Enter" },
  { command: "Type", text: "[" },
  { command: "Command Down" },
  { command: "Command Enter" },
  { command: "Type", text: "];" },
  { command: "Up" },
  { command: "Shift Up", times: 3 },
  { command: "Tab" },
  { command: "Command Up" },
  { command: "Type", text: "const tests = " },
]} />


## Matching every instance

In the example above, we matched four tests. That's a pretty small number of tests, especially for a library that evaluates math expressions.

Pressing <Command>Command D</Command> three times is not a lot of work, but if the number of tests were increased to 1,000 we would need to press <Command>Command D</Command> 999 times. This goes against our goal of making repeated changes grow non-linearly.

This is a nice time to introduce <Command>Shift Command L</Command>, which is the keyboard shortcut for _Select All Matches_.

```javascript
const element = document.querySelect("#container");

if (element && element.hasAttribute("data-active")) {
  element.classList.add("active");
}
// @script select-all-matches
```

<CodeScript id="select-all-matches" script={[
  { command: "Option Right", times: 2 },
  { command: "Shift Option Left", msAfter: 800 },
  { command: "Shift Command L" },
]} />

<NotMacOs>
  <SmallNote label="">Select All Matches with <Command small faded>Shift Control L</Command> on Windows and Linux.</SmallNote>
</NotMacOs>

You have to be a bit more careful with <Command>Shift Command L</Command>, since it selects __every__ match in a file. You may match something that you did not intend to, which can occur outside of the current viewport.

For this reason, I prefer <Command>Command D</Command> when working with a small number of matches. The matching feels more local, you visually see every match happen.


## Skipping an instance

When selecting matches, you may want to skip an instance. To skip a match, press <Command>Command K</Command> followed by <Command>Command D</Command>.

```javascript
// @script rename-button
const button = document.createElement("button");

button.addEventListener("click", handleSubmit);
button.className = "button";
button.innerText = "Submit";

buttonContainer.appendChild(button);
```

<CodeScript id="rename-button" script={[
  { command: "Select Word", line: 1, word: "button" },
  { command: "Command D", msAfter: 1000 },
  { command: "Command K D", msAfter: 300 },
  { command: "Command D", times: 2, msBetween: 600, msAfter: 1000 },
  { command: "Command K D", msAfter: 300 },
  { command: "Command D", msAfter: 950 },
  { command: "Command K D", msAfter: 600 },
  { command: "Type", text: "submitButton" },
]} />

<NotMacOs>
  <SmallNote label="">Skip matches with <Command small faded>Control K</Command> followed by <Command small faded>Control D</Command> on Windows and Linux.</SmallNote>
</NotMacOs>

In order to skip a match, you first need to add the match to the selection. After you have added a match to your selection, press <Command>Command K</Command> and <Command>Command D</Command> to unselect it and select the next match.

Pressing <Command>Command K</Command> and <Command>Command D</Command> resolves to a command called __Move Last Selection to Next Find Match__. It's quite a technical name, but basically means

 * remove the most recent match, and
 * select the next match.

This is not very intuitive at first, but becomes second-nature given enough practice.


## Matching line breaks

Matching every line can be useful when working with arbitrary data.

Take this text file:

```
Python
Java
C++
Go
Rust
Elixir
```

Let's say that we want to convert the lines of this file into a JSON array of strings:

```javascript
[
  "Python",
  "Java",
  "C++",
  "Go",
  "Rust",
  "Elixir",
]
```

There is no pattern across these lines, so matching each line seems impossible. However, <Command>Command D</Command> allows us to match newlines.

```javascript
// @script match-newlines expectedLines=8
Python
Java
C++
Go
Rust
Elixir
```

<CodeScript id="match-newlines" script={[
  { command: "Shift Command Enter" },
  { command: "Type", text: "[" },
  { command: "Command Down" },
  { command: "Command Enter" },
  { command: "Type", text: "]" },
  { command: "Command Up" },
  { command: "Down" },
  { command: "Command Right" },
  { command: "Shift Right" },
  { command: "Command D", times: 5 },
  { command: "Left" },
  { command: "Shift Command Left" },
  { command: "Wrap", text: "\"" },
  { command: "Right", times: 2 },
  { command: "Type", text: "," },
  { command: "Command Left" },
  { command: "Tab" },
  { command: "Command Up" },
]} />

Matching newlines is occasionally useful when

 * matching every line, or
 * matching a pattern that only appears at the end of a line, or
 * matching a pattern that spans two or more lines.

For an example of matching a multi-line pattern, take this example of only matching the empty arrays:

```javascript
// @script match-empty-arrays
const entries = {
  a: [
  ],
  b: [
    { id: 1 },
    { id: 2 },
  ],
  c: [
    { id: 3 },
  ],
  d: [
  ],
  e: [
  ],
 }
```

<CodeScript id="match-empty-arrays" script={[
  { command: "Down" },
  { command: "Command Right" },
  { command: "Left" },
  { command: "Shift Down" },
  { command: "Command D", times: 2 },
  { command: "Right" },
  { command: "Left", times: 2 },
  { command: "Shift Up" },
  { command: "Shift Command Right" },
  { command: "Backspace" },
]} />


## Case transformations

Translating between cases (such as changing snake-case to camelCase) comes up from time-to-time. I typically encounter this case when working across HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

VS Code has a handy `Transform to Uppercase` command that we can combine with <Command>Command D</Command> to make this happen.

```javascript
// @script snake-case-to-camelcase expectedLines=13
function getAttributes(el) {
}

<div
  data-active="false"
  data-x="0"
  data-y="0"
  data-has-modified="false"
/>
```

<CodeScript id="snake-case-to-camelcase" script={[
  { command: "Select Word", line: 5, word: "=\"" },
  { command: "Command D", times: 3 },
  { command: "Left" },
  { command: "Shift Command Left" },
  { command: "Copy" },
  { command: "Command Up" },
  { command: "Command Enter" },
  { command: "Paste" },
  { command: "Shift Up", times: 2 },
  { command: "Tab" },
  { command: "Left", times: 3 },
  { command: "Up" },
  { command: "Shift Right" },
  { command: "Command D", times: 4 },
  { command: "Backspace" },
  { command: "Shift Right" },
  { command: "Exec", label: "Transform to Uppercase", trigger: "editor.action.transformToUppercase" },
  { command: "Command Left" },
  { command: "Type", text: "const " },
  { command: "Command Right" },
  { command: "Type", text: " = el.getAttribute(\"\");" },
  { command: "Left", times: 3 },
  { command: "Paste" },
]} />

There is not a direct keyboard shortcut for the `Transform to Uppercase` command. In VS Code, you can run it by opening the command prompt with <Command>Shift Command P</Command> and then typing the name of the command.

<SmallNote>Unfortunately, you will not be able to use the `Transform to Uppercase` method in this editor. This post uses Monaco Editor, which does not have VS Code's command prompt.</SmallNote>


## That's a wrap!

There are many ways to do multi-cursor editing using VS Code, but I find <Command>Command D</Command> to be the simplest and most useful method.

Take what you learned in this post and apply it in your own work! There is a learning curve, but if you get past it then I promise that <Command>Command D</Command> will prove itself to be a really useful and productive tool.

Thanks for reading the post!
